    <p>Harcha (or harsha) is a Moroccan pan-fried bread made from semolina.<br> Although it looks a bit like an English muffin, it's more like cornbread in texture and taste. Recipes for harcha vary from family to family.<br> This one is quite rich in that it uses all butter and milkâ€”it is delicious, especially when hot from the griddle! </p>
    
    <p>Offer harcha for tea time or breakfast; they're best served warm with jam, cheese, or syrup made from melted butter and honey.<br> For a step-by-step tutorial, see how to make harcha.</p>
    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 cups (350 grams) fine semolina (not durum flour) 
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tablespoons sugar 
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons baking powder 
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 teaspoon salt 
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup (125 grams) soft or melted unsalted butter 
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 to 3/4 cup (120 to 180 milliliters) milk 
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup coarse semolina, optional
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, blend together the fine semolina, sugar, baking powder, and salt.<br> Add the butter, and blend with your hands or a wooden spoon just until the mixture is the consistency of sand and the semolina grains have all been moistened.  </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup milk and mix until dough forms. It should be quite moist, wet almost, and easily packed into a large mound.<br> Add additional milk if necessary to achieve this consistency. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Shape the dough into balls any size that you like and leave the dough to rest a few minutes. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. While the griddle is heating, roll the balls in the coarse semolina,<br> if using, and flatten each ball into a disc about 1/4-inch thick, or a bit thicker if you like. </li>
        <hr>
        <li> Cook the harcha over fairly low heat, about 5 to 10 minutes on each side, until they turn a pale to medium golden color.<br> Flip only once, and check occasionally to be sure the harcha aren't coloring too quickly, as they need some time to cook all the way through. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>   Serve immediately with jam, cheese, or butter. </li>
    </ol>
