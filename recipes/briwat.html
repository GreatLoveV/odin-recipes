    <p>Briouats are small Moroccan pastries which are stuffed with a variety of fillings and then fried.<br> This recipe features ground meat (kefta, kofta or kufta) enclosed in crisp, paper-thin Moroccan pastry called warqa.<br> Phyllo (fillo) dough or spring roll wrappers can be substituted for the warqa. </p>
    <p>Kefta briouats are usually served as a finger food or appetizer, but they can also be served as an entrée.<br> This filling is mildly seasoned. Also try Spicy Kefta Briouats. </p>
    <p>The recipe includes instructions to enclose the kefta in the pastry and fold the briouats into triangles. </p>

        <li>1 teaspoon cumin </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper </li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon </li>
        <li>8 tablespoons butter , divided</li>
        <li>Handful fresh parsley leaves, chopped</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>About 1 1/10 pound (1/2 kilogram) warqa, or filo dough, or large spring roll wrappers</li>

        <li>Oil, for frying </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Mix the ground meat with the onion and spices in bowl. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet or frying pan and add the ground meat mixture.<br> Cook over medium heat, stirring to break up the meat into fine pieces until the meat is well browned and thoroughly cooked.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Stir in the parsley and the three eggs, and cook over medium-high heat just until the liquids are absorbed.<br> You should be able to pack and mold the meat. Set the kefta filling aside. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>With scissors, cut the pastry dough into strips about two-and-a-half inches wide.<br> Place a single strip of warqa or spring roll wrapper – or two layered strips of phyllo dough – on your work surface.<br> (If the strip of warqa is less than 10 inches long, use two layers.)</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Melt the remaining butter and lightly brush melted butter on the bottom two-thirds of the dough strips.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Place a large tablespoon of filling towards the bottom of the strip, and fold the bottom up to enclose the filling.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Fold the bottom left corner of the enclosed dough upwards to the right, aligning it with the right edge of the strip. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Then flip the bottom right corner upwards to the left, aligning it with the left edge of the dough. You should see a triangle take shape.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Continue folding the triangle, flipping right and then left in this manner, until you reach the end of the dough.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Trim any excess length off the edge of the dough, dab it with a little egg yolk, and tuck the end of the dough into the "pocket" formed by the open edge of dough on the briouat.<br> You can use the tip of a butter knife or your scissors to help tuck in the flap of dough. </li>
        <hr>
        <li>Deep fry the briouats in hot oil until light golden brown. Drain and serve.<br> Briouats stay warm for a long time, but if frying them well in advance of serving, you can reheat them in a 350 degree F oven for five to 10 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
